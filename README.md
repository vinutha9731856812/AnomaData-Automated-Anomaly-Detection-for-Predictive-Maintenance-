# AnomaData-Automated-Anomaly-Detection-for-Predictive-Maintenance-

<ul>
<li>Many different industries need predictive maintenance solutions to reduce risks and gain actionable insights through processing data from their equipment.</li>
<li>Although system failure is a very general issue that can occur in any machine, predicting the failure and taking steps to prevent such failure is mostimportant for any machine or software application.</li>
<li>Predictive maintenance evaluates the condition of equipment by performing online monitoring. The goal is to perform maintenance before the equipment degrades or breaks down.</li>
<li>This Capstone project is aimed at predicting the machine breakdown by identifying the anomalies in the data.</li>
<li>The data we have contains about 18000+ rows collected over few days. The column ‘y’ contains the binary labels, with 1 denoting there is an anomaly. The rest of the columns are predictors.  </li>
